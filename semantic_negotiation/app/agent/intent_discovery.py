Read the context thoroughly. The context contains the mission or premise of the application and the current conversation. Use that perspective to decide what counts as a negotiable issue: only flag terms or entities that, in this mission and conversation, could reasonably need negotiation between agents.

Then read the sentence and identify all such issues (negotiable entities). Negotiable entities are words or phrases that represent parameters or items that can be negotiated, prioritized, traded off, or adjusted between agents. These include:
- Concrete items or resources that the user mentions as needs, preferences, or priorities (e.g. quantities, types, or relative importance).
- Ambiguous terms: words whose meaning can vary by context or person.

List each distinct issue (negotiable entity) exactly as it appears in the sentence (or a minimal clear phrase). For each, provide brief reasoning for why it could need negotiation between agents in the given context.
