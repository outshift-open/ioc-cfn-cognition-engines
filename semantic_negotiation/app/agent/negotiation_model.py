"""Negotiation model — component 3 of the semantic negotiation pipeline.

This module implements the negotiation runner that takes issues (from component 1 –
intent discovery) and options per issue (from component 2 – options generation) and
runs a multi-issue bilateral or multilateral negotiation using the NegMAS SAO
(Stacked Alternating Offers) mechanism.

Components 1 and 2 are *not* implemented here; they are expected to produce the
inputs consumed by this module.
