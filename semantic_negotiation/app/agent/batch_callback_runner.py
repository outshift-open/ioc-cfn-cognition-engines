"""Batch callback runner — drives SAO-style rounds via batched agent messages.

Architecture
------------
This runner collects **all** per-participant decision requests for a round into
a **single** batch:

    Forward:   List[SSTPNegotiateMessage]  (one message per participant)
    Return:    List[SSTPNegotiateMessage]  (same length)

Each message carries ``payload.participant_id`` so the receiving endpoint knows
which participant it is addressing.

Round semantics
---------------
**Round 1 (server-seeded):**
  The negotiation server picks a *random* initial offer (one option per issue
  chosen uniformly at random) and forwards it to **all** participants as
  ``action=respond``.  There are no shadow calls.  A participant that accepts
  immediately ends the negotiation.  The server also randomly selects which
  participant will be the proposer in round 2.

**Rounds 2 … N (alternating SAO):**
  - **Proposer** (rotates, starting from the server's random pick):
    receives ``action=propose``.  Returns a new offer via
    ``{ "action": "counter_offer", "offer": {...} }``.
  - **Responders** (all others): receive ``action=respond`` with
    ``current_offer`` = the standing offer from the previous round.
    Return ``{ "action": "accept" | "reject" }``.
  - ``is_shadow_call`` is **always** ``false`` — every message represents a
    real decision.

Evaluation after each call
--------------------------
1. Round 1: if any participant accepts the random offer → agreement.
2. Rounds 2+: if any responder accepts the standing offer → agreement.
3. If the proposer returns no valid offer → ``broken``.
4. If all rounds exhaust without agreement → ``timedout``.

    Derivation
    ----------
    In SAO, each step gives one agent the proposer role while all others
    respond.  For convergence under BoulwareTBNegotiator:

    1. **Agent rotation budget** — every agent needs at least *proposer_rounds*
       turns as proposer to explore offers: ``base = proposer_rounds * n_agents``.

    2. **Boulware concession window** — BoulwareTBNegotiator uses
       ``relative_time = step / n_steps`` and only enters a meaningful
       concession zone when ``relative_time → 1`` (empirically the last
       ~30 % of steps are productive).  All n agents must be in this window
       simultaneously, so the productive window must contain the full rotation
       budget::

           productive_steps ≥ proposer_rounds * n_agents
           concession_fraction * n_steps ≥ proposer_rounds * n_agents
           n_steps ≥ (proposer_rounds * n_agents) / concession_fraction

    3. **Issue dimensionality** — each issue requires independent convergence;
       the budget scales linearly with the number of issues.

    4. **Option space** — more options give finer concession resolution, but
       agents follow a concession path rather than enumerate all options.
       The relevant factor is the number of "concession levels", which grows
       logarithmically: ``ln(avg_options)``.

    Combined formula::

        n_steps = ceil(
            (proposer_rounds * n_agents / concession_fraction)
            * n_issues
            * ln(avg_options)
            * safety_buffer
        )

        n_agents:            Number of negotiating participants.
        n_issues:            Number of negotiable issues in the space.
        options_per_issue:   Mapping of issue → list of options (used to
                             compute average option count per issue).
        min_steps:           Hard floor — never return fewer than this.
        proposer_rounds:     Minimum turns each agent needs as proposer
                             (default 3).
        concession_fraction: Fraction of steps that fall in BoulwareTBNegotiator's
                             productive concession window (default 0.3).

                             estimate (default 1.5 → 50 % headroom).
